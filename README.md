# 🩺 **MEDIBOT — Multi-Agent AI Medical Assistant**

**MEDIBOT** is a next-generation **multi-agent AI system** built for the **medical domain**, designed to act as an intelligent, domain-aware virtual health consultant.  
It combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with advanced **Large Language Models (Google Gemini)** and **LangChain orchestration** to ensure reliable, factual, and safe medical communication.  

Unlike generic chatbots, MEDIBOT operates through an **agentic workflow**, where each specialized agent performs a defined clinical or analytical role — such as diagnosis, lifestyle guidance, or drug information retrieval.  
This distributed design ensures **precision**, **transparency**, and **scalability**, making MEDIBOT a highly adaptable platform for both **educational and professional healthcare applications**.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
MEDIBOT integrates **LangChain**, **Gemini**, **FAISS**, and **HuggingFace embeddings** to provide intelligent, medically accurate conversations.  
It uses an agentic workflow — each agent performs a specialized medical task, ensuring precision, safety, and adaptability.

### 🧩 **Core Features**
- 💊 **Drug Info Agent** — Fetches FDA-verified drug details  
- ⚖️ **BMI Agent** — Calculates BMI with personalized health guidance  
- 🩺 **Diagnosis Agent** — Identifies possible diseases via PubMed + RAG  
- 🧘 **Lifestyle Agent** — Generates fitness & diet plans (WGER + Gemini)  
- 🧬 **Research Agent** — Retrieves & summarizes latest EuropePMC studies  
- 🖼️ **Image Agent** — Creates educational medical diagrams via Gemini / HF

### 🧠 **Architecture**
![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

**Flow Summary:**  
User Input → Intent Detection → Specialized Agent → LLM (Gemini) → Semantic Evaluation → Output + Logging  

Each agent interacts independently with external APIs or internal retrievers and sends results through the **Gemini reasoning layer**, ensuring accuracy, factual grounding, and clarity in responses.
