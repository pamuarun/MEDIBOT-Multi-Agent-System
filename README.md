# 🩺 **MEDIBOT — Multi-Agent AI Medical Assistant**

**MEDIBOT** is a next-generation **multi-agent AI system** built for the **medical domain**, designed to act as an intelligent, domain-aware virtual health consultant.  
It combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with advanced **Large Language Models (Google Gemini)** and **LangChain orchestration** to ensure reliable, factual, and safe medical communication.  

Unlike generic chatbots, MEDIBOT operates through an **agentic workflow**, where each specialized agent performs a defined clinical or analytical role — such as diagnosis, lifestyle guidance, or drug information retrieval.  
This distributed design ensures **precision**, **transparency**, and **scalability**, making MEDIBOT a highly adaptable platform for both **educational and professional healthcare applications**.  

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
MEDIBOT integrates **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **Gemini**, **FAISS**, and **HuggingFace embeddings** to provide intelligent, medically accurate conversations.  
It uses an agentic workflow — each agent performs a specialized medical task, ensuring precision, safety, and adaptability.

**Flow Summary:**  
User Input → Intent Detection → Specialized Agent → LLM (Gemini) → Semantic Evaluation → Output + Logging  

**Detailed Agent Descriptions:**

- **Drug Info Agent**  
  - Fetches accurate, FDA-verified drug details.  
  - Provides dosage, side effects, interactions, and warnings.  
  - Integrates with OpenFDA API for real-time updates.  

- **BMI Agent**  
  - Calculates Body Mass Index based on user-provided height and weight.  
  - Offers personalized health guidance and risk analysis.  

- **Diagnosis Agent**  
  - Identifies potential diseases using symptom input.  
  - Combines PubMed research with RAG methodology for evidence-based suggestions.  
  - Provides ranked possibilities and confidence scores.  

- **Lifestyle Agent**  
  - Generates fitness, nutrition, and wellness plans.  
  - Uses WGER API and Gemini LLM to create personalized guidance.  

- **Research Agent**  
  - Retrieves and summarizes recent studies from EuropePMC.  
  - Provides facts, statistics, and scientific references for informed decisions.  

- **Image Agent**  
  - Generates educational medical diagrams and visual aids.  
  - Utilizes Gemini and HuggingFace models for high-quality visual outputs.  

Each agent interacts independently with external APIs or internal retrievers and sends results through the **Gemini reasoning layer**, ensuring accuracy, factual grounding, and clarity in responses.
